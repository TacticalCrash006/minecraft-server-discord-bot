# minecraft-server-discord-bot
Made this discord bot to run a spigot MC server when a command is called so my friends don't have to bug me when I am not home. Could use some touch ups but this is something I wrote in maybe 3 hours? I don't have too much experience with python

With this project it uses a .env file for the discord bot token so it's not directly into the code. Just create a .env file and on Line 1 type "DISCORD_TOKEN=---ENTER BOT TOKEN HERE---". And then of course set your path files correctly and you're golden!
